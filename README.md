# hash-calculator-website
Website written using django framework, that calculates hashes of a string submitted by the user.

## Disclaimer
I do not know CSS well, because of that I've coded it in such way that the website looks decent only on 1920x1080 computers, the GUI breaks on mobiles.

## Notes
- Strings to hash are passed through the "text" URL parameter, therefore the result can be easily stored or shared
- Main functionality is enclosed within the hash_calculators django app, thus allowing to implement the hash calculator in other websites conveniently
